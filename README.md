# Uni-Shame
I java and cry

This is a small java project.
We first used JDBC to makes requests to the university DB.
Then we learnt to implement Hibernate to our code.

Now, my goal is to update, insert, delete info from three main tables(completed)and
in the future learn how to JOIN them(on development).


In the far future, I`ll work on creating my Data base and end my dependency on the university server.
