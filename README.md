# DDSI project


This is a small java project.
We first used JDBC to makes requests to the university DB.
Then we learnt to implement Hibernate to our code.

Now, my goal is to update, insert, delete info from the tables(completed)and
in the future JOIN them(on development).


Also, after learning how to implement well all data base requestes, I'll try to implement security features from 
OWASP top 10. (in process).


In the far future, I`ll work on creating my Data base and end my dependency on the university server.



Thank you
